# Ridership Visualisation (WIP)

- Streamlit webapp
- main page will have historical cmrl dashboard (Exact dashboards from cmrl website for Ridership, Parking, PHPDT with slider to go through historical dates)
- create an API that loads the CSVs from github source (so that it is always up to date) and provides multiple getters (ridership on a specific date, PHPDT on a specific date for a certain line, parking at a particular station ID for all time, etc)
- webapp uses API to get data for all the graphs
- apart from main page, will have multiple other visualisations like the phpdt / ridership heatmaps, etc

Essentially serves as a demo for what you can do with the data I am archiving in the other repo.
